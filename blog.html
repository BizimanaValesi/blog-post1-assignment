Bash Script for Project Setup</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the world of web development, efficiency is key. Our Bash script
is a game-changer for developers, designed to automate the task of
setting up a new web project. It not only saves time but also introduces
a standard structure to every project you begin.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Typically, starting a new project involves creating a set of
directories and files, setting up a version control system, and writing
some initial boilerplate code. This script encapsulates all these steps
into a single, simple command.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-features">Detailed Features</h2>
<h3 id="project-structure-creation">Project Structure Creation</h3>
<p>The script creates a well-organized directory structure, including
separate folders for CSS, JavaScript, assets, and configuration. This
organization is crucial for maintaining clean and manageable
codebases.</p>
<h3 id="boilerplate-generation">Boilerplate Generation</h3>
<p>For the <code>index.html</code>, <code>style.css</code>, and
<code>script.js</code> files, the script writes essential starter code.
The HTML file includes basic meta tags for responsiveness and SEO, the
CSS file starts with a reset script and fundamental styling, and the
JavaScript file is ready with a DOMContentLoaded event listener.</p>
<h3 id="validation-checks">Validation Checks</h3>
<p>I have added a simple yet effective validation check to ensure that
the CSS and JS files are not empty, preventing common oversights.</p>
<h3 id="version-control-integration">Version Control Integration</h3>
<p>A .gitignore file is automatically created, and the script
initializes a Git repository in the project folder. This first commit
sets you on the right path for version control.</p>
<h3 id="developer-convenience">Developer Convenience</h3>
<p>To boost productivity, the script opens the project in Visual Studio
Code, allowing you to dive straight into coding.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-script">How to Use the Script</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ensure you have Git and Visual Studio Code installed.</li>
<li>Place the script in the right location.</li>
<li>Run the script using the command below, replacing
<code>YourProjectName</code> with your desired project name: ```bash
