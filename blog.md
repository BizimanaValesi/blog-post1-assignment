# Guide to Using  Bash Script for Project Setup

## Introduction
In the world of web development, efficiency is key. Our Bash script is a game-changer for developers, designed to automate the  task of setting up a new web project. It not only saves time but also introduces a standard structure to every project you begin.

## Background
Typically, starting a new project involves creating a set of directories and files, setting up a version control system, and writing some initial boilerplate code. This script encapsulates all these steps into a single, simple command.

## Detailed Features
### Project Structure Creation
The script creates a well-organized directory structure, including separate folders for CSS, JavaScript, assets, and configuration. This organization is crucial for maintaining clean and manageable codebases.

### Boilerplate Generation
For the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files, the script writes essential starter code. The HTML file includes basic meta tags for responsiveness and SEO, the CSS file starts with a reset script and fundamental styling, and the JavaScript file is ready with a DOMContentLoaded event listener.

### Validation Checks
I have added a simple yet effective validation check to ensure that the CSS and JS files are not empty, preventing common oversights.

### Version Control Integration
A .gitignore file is automatically created, and the script initializes a Git repository in the project folder. This first commit sets you on the right path for version control.

### Developer Convenience
To boost productivity, the script opens the project in Visual Studio Code, allowing you to dive straight into coding.

## How to Use the Script
1. Ensure you have Git and Visual Studio Code installed.
2. Place the script in the right location.
3. Run the script using the command below, replacing `YourProjectName` with your desired project name:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh YourProjectName
